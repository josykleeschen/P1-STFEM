This repository contains code of an implementation of a Space-Time-Finite-Element-Method for polynomial degree 1. 
The implementation is based on the article "Well-Posedness of First-Order Acoustic Wave Equations and Space-Time Finite Element Approximation",
by Thomas Führer, Roberto González and Michael Karkulik.
Here is the link to the print: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10536
